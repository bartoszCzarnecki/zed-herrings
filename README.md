## Summary

This project aims to analyze the sizes of oceanic herring based on historical data from the past 60 years. The dataset includes information about herring sizes and their living conditions. The main objective is to predict herring lengths using a random forest regressor, utilizing various attributes provided in the dataset.

The applied random forest regressor demonstrates satisfactory results, as indicated by the RMSE and RÂ² scores, suggesting that it is possible to predict herring lengths based on the dataset. The analysis suggests that the main factors influencing the decreasing average length of oceanic herring are changes in surface water temperature, fishing intensity, and annual recruitment.
